Hello, I am a Software Engineer, Working in the Deep Learning team at Proteinea where I spend my time working on Protein Language Models, my main hobby is writing code, usually in Python.

I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and I tried many stuff before entering AI including backend and I am lucky that I kept exploring many fields.
